**Information Retrieval Repository**

Welcome to the Information Retrieval repository! This collection of scripts is designed to empower you with powerful conventional and neural models for extracting valuable information from large commonsense corpuses. Whether you're working on natural language processing tasks, question-answering systems, or any application that requires efficient information retrieval, this repository has you covered.

Key Features
RAG Retriever: Leverage the Retriever-Aggregator-Generator (RAG) architecture to efficiently retrieve relevant information from vast corpuses. The RAG retriever is known for its effectiveness in handling diverse types of queries.

Biencoder Retriever: Utilize the biencoder retriever for robust and context-aware information retrieval. This model is designed to balance performance and efficiency in handling various information extraction tasks.

Cross Encoder Reranker: Enhance the precision of your information retrieval with the cross encoder reranker. By re-ranking the retrieved results, you can achieve higher accuracy and relevance in the extracted information.
